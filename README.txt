ALPS 60% keyboard PCB
=====================
Primary goal is to support 60% cut AEK(Apple Extended Keyboard) layout and fits into Poker X cmpatible cases.


Revisions
---------
Rev.A   2015/03

Rev.D   2016/04     Fix Xtal foot print and value of R and C
Rev.E   2016/08     Retouch USB connector footprint and silks
Rev.F   2017/08     Add breakout for unused pins(PC4, PC6, PC7)

Rev.Kc' 2020/06     Add support layouts for AppleIIgs, M0116 and M0118(canceled)
                    Some of mounting screw holes are not usable.


Ideas
-----
### LED ###
Backlight won't support. Indicators may be needed for debug.
LED footprint for ALPS Green?

### PCB mount plate: ###
1.6mm PCB will be OK for switch plate.
SMD LED? WS2812? Matias style underside LED?

### TrackPoint ###
ATMega32u2 has no spare pins for TrackPoint three buttons and signals.

Footprint library
    Centroid: Diode and capacitor footprint
    Pin1 is cathode or capacitor-positive. Pin1 is left for two pin devices like resitor and caps.
    Pin1 is on upper left for many pin device like DIP, QFP, SOT...

    Someone may use Cherry keycaps with stem adapters.
    never seen 1.25u stepped Capslock for Alps, normally 1.5u stepped or 1.75u(no stepped) for Alps

ISP pads:
Support for infinity bottom row: 1.5, 1, 1, 1.5:    DONE 03/05
Thumb keys, split space bar:                        near future
Trackpoint support: mount holes and IO pins:        Future revision
Bluetooth support:                                  Future revision

USB connector should be shifted to outside by 0.3-0.5mm. 04/05

ISO Enter Support:
    ISO Enter key can be used in Rev.B and later revision. The PCB supports three mount positions, 1u, 1.25u and 1.5u. See pictures and figure below. Matias has 1.25u mount, Dell and Alps have 1.5u mount and ISO Enter with 1u mount is not confirmed its existence yet. By the way, Cherry ISO key is also located in middle of 1.25u as Matias does.

(key unit; Top row: Esc[0u], 1[1u], ... 7[7u], ...)


Support Cases
-------------
Poker X case and its compatibles.
Also V60 case are supported hopefully with ballpark figure from pics.

    On their Facebook they said:
    we can screw V60 plate on 4 holes of Poker2/Pure Pro case. Basicly , V60 can fit in Poker 2 case. But V60 has 6 dip switch , Poker 2 only has 4 dip switch. If the back side hole space not enough , the plate touch , not balance.
Poker 2 can not fit in V60 case. Because V60 case is a little smaller than Poker 2.
